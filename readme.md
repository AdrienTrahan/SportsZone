# SportsZone

SportsZone is a comprehensive sports team management app that I developed in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was built using Angular, Ionic, Node.js, MongoDB, and plain HTML/JS/CSS. 

The project eventually got dropped due to lack of time, but it includes all the major features you would expect in a Team management app.


Here's a [quick walkthrough of the app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpDjCxJ37_o&ab_channel=AdrienTrahan) to get a glimpse of its functionality.
