# SportsZone

This is a sports team management app I built in 2020 during Covid using Angular Ionic, node.js, Mongodb, and plain HTML/JS/CSS. 

The project eventually got dropped due to lack of time, but it includes all the major features you would expect in a Team management app.

The app works on android, iOS and the web and here's a quick <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpDjCxJ37_o&ab_channel=AdrienTrahan">demo</a>.
